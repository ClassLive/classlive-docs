## Hello! Welcome, to ClassLive!

ClassLive is almost ready for release so here is a blog post.

If you are wondering on a release date, it would be January or Feburary (for the first gameshow)  
More likely January since the first gameshow is almost done :D  
  


Anyways, the main thing being worked on right now is the gameshow currently nicknamed "Wobble", but I am also working on the question set maker.  
Of course docs will be made for it.
  
I'm not sure how to end this so, goodbye for now!
